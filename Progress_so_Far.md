Commit 1 -
- considering the global waste management challenges, we have decided to take up the challenge of developing an automated Waste Segregation system using        YOLO for real-time time object detection. 
- Our solution aims to streamline the process and promote sustainability.
- We have gathered a dataset of 7510 labeled waste images, covering categories such as cardboard, paper, glass, metal, organic waste, and plastic from Roboflow.
- We are intending to achieve real-time processing efficiency for waste recognition by leveraging the advantages of YOLO.
- Later on, we developed a roadmap that we are going to follow to achieve the prime objective.
- We have put our model for training by letting it run for just one epoch in order to ensure whether the model has been trained correctly or not.


Commit 2 -
- optimized the training of our model by tweaking the epochs.
- Planned to develop a web application for the same where we will be incorporating computer vision, with the help of which one will be able scan the image and our model will detect the waste and henceforth classify the same, that is, whether recyclable or non-recyclable.
- Started by developing basic structure and layout of our web application on paper.


Commit 3 -
-Started coding for the web pages. 
- Gathered more data and added the same in our model.
- The model has been put on for training again and hyperparameters are being tweaked in order to reduce loss value.
