The discussion so far:
- Considering the global waste management challenges, we have decided to take up the challenge of developing an AUTOMATED WASTE SEGRATION SYSTEM 
   using YOLO for real-time time object detection.Our solution aims to streamline the process and promote sustainability.
-	We have gathered a dataset of 7510 labeled waste images, covering categories such as cardboard, paper, glass, metal, organic waste, and plastic from Roboflow.
-	We intend to achieve real-time processing efficiency for waste recognition by leveraging the advantages of YOLO.
-	Later on we are intending to develop a web application for the same where we will be incorporating computer vision, with the help of which one will be able scan the
  image and our model will detect the waste and henceforth classify the same, that is, whether recyclable orÂ non-recyclable.
